Humans Vs. Zombies: Relase B

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Functionality:
-When you run the program, the zombie starts chasing the human. If he touches a
	human, that human becomes a zombie too.
-You can keep track of how many humans are left in the upper left and how many
    zombies exist in the upper right
-If you hit the number keys or click on the specific buttons, various debug modes
    are toggled:
        Zombie Tracing     (1) - Shows the lines from each zombie to which human it's 
            tracking
        Human Tracing      (2) - Shows the lines from each human to the zombie it's 
            fleeing, if it is fleeing a zombie
        Transforms         (3) - Shows the forward and right vectors
        Future Position    (4) - Shows where the vehicles will be in TIME_AHEAD 
            frames(default: 10)
        Velocity           (5) - Shows the vehicles' velocity vectors
        Obstacle Detection (6) - Shows lines from vehicles to any obstacles in
            thier site path
        Steering Force     (7) - Shows the steering force vectors
-Clicking anywhere else on the screen or pressing 'H' will produce a human
-Right clicking anywhere on the screen or pressing 'Z' will produce a zombie


Reason Behind Design Choices:
-I chose to make the vehicles seek the center line instead of the center when they
	hit a wall because it looked more natural. When they were seeking the
	center, they would often turn back around and run straight into the zombie
-I used spritesheets from one of the links on myCourses to make the scene look
    better, but the zombies were hard to distinguish from the humans. To fix this
    I added in a sims-esque plumbob, green for zombie and red for human.
-I decided to have two forms of input for everything because when I was testing
    sometimes I was too lazy to use the mouse.

Above and Beyond features:
-I used a spritesheet to create animations in the character walking. The links
    to the spritesheets are below.
-I created a GUI so that each aspect of debugging can be access individually

Requirements not completed:
-None that I'm aware of
